This is a machine learning library with the following features:
- Some statistics on the dataset using pandas
- Skewness and kurtosis of each column in the dataset
- Mean/Std Deviation of each column, grouped into benign/malignant
- Plot some more advanced information using seaboard 
- Pairplot of each column against other columns
- Heatmap of the column correlations
- Implement the K nearest neighbors algorithm from class 
- Use scikit-learn to implement
- K Nearest neighbors (for comparison) 
- Support Vector Machine classifier
